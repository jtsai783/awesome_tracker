AwesomeTracker
==============

This is a tool to track the progress for agile development. Within this tool, each sprint is assumed to be a week, and average velocity is calcuated from the day a project starts, rounded up.

Users can create project, and user stories within projects. User stories can be freely dragged from one column to another. If a story is dragged to the 'Done' column, it will be counted in the average velocity calculation. If the story is in the 'Current' column, it will be counted in the current load.

The goal is to use your average velocity to calculate how fast you're completing the project, and match your current load with the average velocity.
